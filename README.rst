pandoc-quotes
=============

``pandoc-quotes`` is a filter for `Pandoc <http://pandoc.org/>`_ that replaces
plain, that is, non-typographic, quotation marks with typographic ones.

You can define which typographic quotation marks to replace plain ones with
by setting either a document's ``quotation-marks``, ``quotation-language``,
or ``lang`` metadata field. Typically, it should "just work".

See the `manual page <man/pandoc-quotes.rst>`_ for more details.

If you are using Pandoc 2.0 or newer, you will want to use 
`pandoc-quotes.lua <https://github.com/odkr/pandoc-quotes.lua>`_ instead;
it's easier to install and faster.


Caveats
=======

``pandoc`` represents documents as abstract syntax trees, and quotations are
nodes in that tree. However, ``pandoc-quotes`` replaces those nodes with the
content of the quotation, adding proper quotation marks. Put another way,
``pandoc-quotes`` pushes quotations from the syntax of a document's
representation into its semantics. As a consequence, ``pandoc`` will no longer
recognise quotes. Also, filters running after ``pandoc-quotes`` won't either.
Therefore, you should *not* use ``pandoc-quotes`` with output formats that
represent quotes syntactically (e.g., HTML, LaTeX, ConTexT). Also, it should
be the last or one of the last filters you apply.


Installing ``pandoc-quotes``
============================

You use ``pandoc-quotes`` **at your own risk**. You have been warned.

You need `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 2.7 or newer,
`panflute <https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute>`_, and
`PyYAML <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml>`_.

Simply run::

    pip install pandoc_quotes

This will try to install ``pandoc-quotes`` manual page, but this
will only work on a limited number of systems.

Alternatively, you can also download the source for the `current version
<https://codeload.github.com/odkr/pandoc-quotes/tar.gz/v0.6.0>`_.

Simply run::

    curl https://codeload.github.com/odkr/pandoc-quotes/tar.gz/v0.6.0 | tar -xz
    cd pandoc-quotes-0.6.0
    python setup.py install
